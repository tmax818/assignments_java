## Checklist

- [ ] Implement the [Order]() and [Item]() classes as described above.

- [ ] Create a testing file to complete the test cases for each method.

- [ ] Create 2 orders for unspecified guests (without specifying a name);

- [ ] Create 3 orders using the overloaded constructor to give each a name for the order.

- [ ] Implement the addItem method within the Order class

- [ ] Add at least 2 items to each of the orders using the addItem method you wrote, for example, to add item1 to order3 you would need to call the addItem method from the order3 instance like so: order3.addItem(item1);

- [ ] Implement the getStatusMessage method within the Order class

- [ ] Test your getStatusMessage functionality by setting some orders to ready and printing the messages for each order. For example: `order2.setReady(true);` `System.out.println(order2.getStatusMessage());`

- [ ] Implement the getOrderTotal method within the Order class

- [ ] Test the total by printing the return value like so: System.out.println(order1.getOrderTotal());

- [ ] Implement the display method within the Order class

- [ ] Finally, call the display method on all of your orders, like so: order3.display();
