## checklist

- [ ] Create a [Mammal](Mammal.java) class that has an `energyLevel` member variable and `displayEnergy()` method. The `displayEnergy()` method should show the animal's energy level as well as return it.

- [ ] Create a separate class [Gorilla](Gorilla.java) that can `throwSomething()`, `eatBananas()`, and `climb()`

- [ ] For the `throwSomething()` method, have it print out a message indicating that the gorilla has thrown something, as well as decrease the energy level by 5

- [ ] For the `eatBananas()` method, have it print out a message indicating the gorilla's satisfaction and increase its energy by 10

- [ ] For the `climb()` method, have it print out a message indicating the gorilla has climbed a tree and decrease its energy by 10

- [ ] Create a [GorillaTest](GorillaTest.java) class to instantiate a gorilla and have it throw three things, eat bananas twice, and climb once.

- [ ] Create a [Bat](Bat.java) class that can `fly()`, `eatHumans()`, and `attackTown()` and has a default energy level of 300.

- [ ] For the `fly()` method, print the sound of a bat taking off and decrease its energy by 50.

- [ ] For the `eatHumans()` method, print the so- well, never mind, just increase its energy by 25.

- [ ] For the `attackTown()` method, print the sound of a town on fire and decrease its energy by 100.

- [ ] Create a [BatTest](BatTest.java) class to instantiate a bat and have it attack three towns, eat two humans, and fly twice.
